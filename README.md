# Arc'teryx Front-End Capstone - Amanda's Modules

- In this project, my teammates and I created a copy of an Arc'teryx web application page. We will be re-creating the aesthetics and interactivity of the page as accurately as possible--when someone opens our app, it should feel indistinguishable from the real thing. Except, in the case that we find something that we can optimize to improve performance.

- I was responsible for the product detail and product viewer.

    - The product detail module shows information about a given product, and shows available sizes and colors.
    - The product viewer module shows one main image, and when clicked, opens up a modal for infinite-loop viewing of the available images for a product.
